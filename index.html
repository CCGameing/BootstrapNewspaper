              This page was made as a class project for BootStrap 5

              Here is a story
            </p>
            <p>
              The Day was Thursday, September 29th, just another day of school. It started with me waking up a bit later than normal, but this wasn't an issue. It was actually better considering I arrived at school earlier than everybody else. After talking with my friends at breakfast, it was time to head to our Computer Science class. Today we were assigned an unexpected but not unusual task. We need to write a full story and implement it into a website. I thought "This isn't English class, this is computer science!" which is true, but then an idea came to me. "We are in computer science, so it would make sense if I got the computer to write it’s own story". After this thought, I got to work.
            </p>

            <p>
              I got a computer and started programming. I started creating a prototype website and getting creative with it. This required the computer to write a story and perform certain actions within the story. The computer could decide what to do based on the story and what was in the story. I needed to teach the computer how to write a story as well as how to perform certain tasks within the story. The more the computer worked, the better its story and actions became. I began writing a story for the computer to write. The computer's story was a simple combination of "Human tries to get food" and "Man does not have enough food". I turned this into a 1-3 sentence story, and that's what I gave to thecomputer to perform.
            </p>

            <p>
              After that, I sat down at my computer and wrote the website. Then it was time to teach the computer how to use it. The last part of the exercise is teaching the computer how to use the website. This was relatively easy and all it took was "This will open a window".


And that's when it hit me. What if I taught my computer how to write a story? What if I gave the computer the power to write a website, just like any other computer? How?

I gave the computer a function to write. It could write text and draw graphics on a website just like any other website could. I typed this function into the computer and the computer typed it into the website. With this function, the computer could easily create a website just like any other website. It did this just like any other website would, except it could do it in code.
            </p>

            <p>
              I wanted to create a website for the purpose of teaching kids about computer science. So I got the computer to create a website about an imaginary story. The website used graphics, but other than that, it was a website that looked like any other website. Only the code of the website was different, and the code looked like computer code. I needed to write computer code for the website, but I also needed to teach the computer how to write computer code. With that, it was time for me to teach computer science to my class. I sat down at my computer and thought of some questions. How do I teach computer programming to a computer? How do I write computer programs? How do I teach computer programming?


You may say "This is the computer's code, it's written in computer language, and it's the computer's code." This is true, but the computer also writes in regular language. We learned in Computer Science 101 about how programming languages have special syntax, but when you write in computer language you need to also write in regular language. And I did just that. I was able to teach computer programming to my class by giving the computer the power to write code and write regular language at the same time. It worked perfectly!
            </p>

            <p>
              I wrote a few different computer programs that required regular language and computer language and wrote the program in both languages. When I went to make a computer program, I could see that the computer was able to write code and regular language. That's when I knew my experiment was a success. With a little bit of computer science and some fancy websites, kids have a computer science background just like I have computer science.

My experiment also made it possible for kids to learn computer science by actually using computers. There is nothing more fun than using computers to create something new and then share it with everyone.
